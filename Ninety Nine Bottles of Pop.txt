Ninety Nine Bottles of Pop and lemonade

99 bottles of pop on the wall
99 bottles of pop
If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
98 bottles of pop on the wall.

98 bottles of pop on the wall
98 bottles of pop
If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
97 bottles of pop on the wall.

Now I will count how many bottles on the floor
99 bottles subtract 97
Equals to 2
So there's 2 bottles on the floor.

Two hours later,
There is only one bottle of pop on the wall
one bottle of pop.
If the last bottle should happen to fall,
Guess how many bottles are on the wall.

99 bottles of lemonade on the wall
99 bottles of lemonade
If one of those bottles should happen to fall,
98 bottles of lemonade on the wall.
